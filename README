This is the README file of the DomainSharedContactsEditor (DSCE) python application.

  The primary goal or vision is to provide an easy to use and well designed program 
to create, update, delete, and view shared contacts of your Google Apps Premier and 
Education Editions domain. Despite its focus on shared contacts it can also be used 
to edit and view private contacts of a gmail account.

  Easy to use means that a new user of the program should be able to perform the basic 
tasks right from the beginning without any special training or reading of hundreds of 
FAQ-, help- or user guide- pages.

  Well designed means that the user interface is free of any kind of gadgetry that 
detracts from its main purpose but it is still able to deliver a well perceived user 
experience. This also includes that messages and explanations provided to the user 
through the program are written in a language that can be interpreted without being a 
computer scientist.
